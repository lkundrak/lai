**lai** (Lux ACPI Implementation) is a lightweight, portable, OS-independent implementation of the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, aimed to provide OS developers with an easy way to use ACPI without having to write actual AML-parsing code.  

When the project is more advanced, I will write documentation on its internals and porting it. For now, it can:
- Create the ACPI namespace, and manage it.
- Execute _really_ few AML opcodes.
